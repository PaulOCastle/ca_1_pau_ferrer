Welcome to Greenways in Ireland

Greenways are trails built to be used exclusively by cyclists, pedestrians and other non motorised transport. 
They are generally traffic-free routes. With no traffic, the routes are generally safer and can be enjoyed by most members of society.

Greenways have become very popular on old disused railway lines. Examples of Greenways that have repurposed old railway lines are
Waterford Greenway
Great Western Greenway
Great Southern Trail
Old Rail Trail

Greenways have also been built along river and canal towpaths. Both the Royal Canal Greenway and the Suir Blueway are built along old towpaths.
